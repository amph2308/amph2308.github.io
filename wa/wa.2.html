<h1> Hey hey, it's <em>Amy!</em></h1>
<h2> any pronouns are fine</h2>
<p> i want to get more comfortable with coding, so my coding folder on my laptop can no longer be named "what is cOdiNg?"
</p>
<p> i'm a media production major specializing in video and creative photography</p>
<p>i like drawing and getting tattoos, hanging out with my roommate's blind cat, and going to punk and metal shows where I park myself on the barriers of the mosh pit
