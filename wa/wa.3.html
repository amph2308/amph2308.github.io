    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Marvin John Heemeyer</strong> (October 28, 1951 – June 4, 2004) was an American automobile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muffler">muffler</a> repair shop owner who demolished numerous buildings with a modified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldozer">bulldozer</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granby,_Colorado">Granby, Colorado</a>, in 2004.
    </p>
    <p>
        Heemeyer had various grudges against Granby town officials, neighbors of his muffler shop, the local press, and various other citizens of Granby. Over about eighteen months, Heemeyer secretly armored a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komatsu_Limited">Komatsu</a> D355A bulldozer with layers of steel and concrete.
    </p>
    <p>
        On Friday, June 4, 2004, Heemeyer used the bulldozer to demolish the Granby town hall, the house of a former mayor, and several other buildings. He killed himself after the bulldozer became stuck in a hardware store he was destroying. No one else was injured or killed,<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160414094159/http://www.theconcreteproducer.com/Images/Terror%20in%20Granby_tcm77-1308172.pdf">[1]</a></sup> in part due to timely evacuation orders.<sup><a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/marvin-heemeyer-killdozer">[2]</a></sup>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Marvin Heemeyer was born on October 28, 1951, on a dairy farm in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota">South Dakota</a>. In 1974, he moved to Colorado because he was stationed at Lowry Air Force Base. In 1989, he moved to Grand Lake, Colorado, about 16 miles (26 km) away from Granby.

    <h3>Gambling Legalization</h3>
    <p>Heemeyer was strongly in favor of gambling legalization and campaigned for the cause on several occasions. At one point, he began disseminating a newspaper of his own on the issue, as he believed the local newspapers were biased against this cause.[9][10]
In 1994, a measure was proposed that would have legalized gambling in Grand Lake. Heemeyer was an avid supporter of the proposal, and so passionate about the cause that he nearly came to blows with a local reporter who was opposed to the proposal.[9]</p>
