    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Marvin John Heemeyer</strong> (October 28, 1951 – June 4, 2004) was an American automobile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muffler">muffler</a> repair shop owner who demolished numerous buildings with a modified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldozer">bulldozer</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granby,_Colorado">Granby, Colorado</a>, in 2004.
    </p>
    <p>
        Heemeyer had various grudges against Granby town officials, neighbors of his muffler shop, the local press, and various other citizens of Granby. Over about eighteen months, Heemeyer secretly armored a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komatsu_Limited">Komatsu</a> D355A bulldozer with layers of steel and concrete.
    </p>
    <p>
        On Friday, June 4, 2004, Heemeyer used the bulldozer to demolish the Granby town hall, the house of a former mayor, and several other buildings. He killed himself after the bulldozer became stuck in a hardware store he was destroying. No one else was injured or killed,<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160414094159/http://www.theconcreteproducer.com/Images/Terror%20in%20Granby_tcm77-1308172.pdf">[1]</a></sup> in part due to timely evacuation orders.<sup><a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/marvin-heemeyer-killdozer">[2]</a></sup>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Marvin Heemeyer was born on October 28, 1951, on a dairy farm in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota">South Dakota</a>. In 1974, he moved to Colorado because he was stationed at Lowry Air Force Base. In 1989, he moved to Grand Lake, Colorado, about 16 miles (26 km) away from Granby. His friends said that he had no relatives in the Granby–Grand Lake area.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Heemeyer#cite_note-rmntnews-6">[3]</a></sup></p>
    <h3>Gambling Legalization</h3>
    <p>Heemeyer was strongly in favor of gambling legalization and campaigned for the cause on several occasions. At one point, he began disseminating a newspaper of his own on the issue, as he believed the local newspapers were biased against this cause.
In 1994, a measure was proposed that would have legalized gambling in Grand Lake. Heemeyer was an avid supporter of the proposal, and so passionate about the cause that he nearly came to blows with a local reporter who was opposed to the proposal.</p>
    <h2>Disputes</h2>
    <p> In November 2000, Heemeyer filed a lawsuit to block a project constructing a concrete plant next to his muffler store. By January 9, 2001, Heemeyer had lost most of his allies in opposition to the concrete plant, and city officials almost unanimously approved its construction. On January 9, 2001, the preliminary plans for the plant were approved near-unanimously, only Heemeyer remained opposed. This made the final approval by Granby's zoning commission and trustees in April a formality.</p>
    <p> In June 2001, Joe Docheff made Heemeyer an offer whereby if Heemeyer dropped the lawsuit, they would provide him an easement to connect a sewer line to the new concrete plant free of charge; Heemeyer just hung up. Around this time, the buried concrete truck barrel that served as Heemeyer's sewage hole filled up. Heemeyer responded by pumping his sewage with a gasoline pump into the irrigation ditch that ran behind his property. Heemeyer also attempted to illegally connect to a neighbor's sewer line, but was caught and the incident reported to the sanitation district. At this point, the sewer district started enforcing the legal requirement to have a sewer hookup or a septic tank and fined Heemeyer $2,500 for it and other city code violations at his business,<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070311015838/http://www.spokesmanreview.com/tools/story_pf.asp?ID=9810">[4]</a></sup> in July 2001, nine years after he was required to have installed either.[12][8] Heemeyer was found in contempt of town code in November 2001 by the municipal court, and required to fix the connection issues before he could inhabit or use the property for business purposes again, as well as remove the truck barrel before July 2003. Heemeyer agreed before later that day rejecting it, and describing the requirements as a "form of terrorism". An attorney at the judgment reported Heemeyer muttering, "I'm just gonna bulldozer this whole place to the ground."</p>
